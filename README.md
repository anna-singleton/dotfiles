# Anna's Dotfiles

Here are my system dotfiles, which are being managed with
[dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter/).

This allows for easy cross-system configuration

For quick-start, use `init` or run the commands manually, like:

```bash
wget https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter/releases/latest/download/dotter
```
